 *
 * <!-- begin JE only -->
 * This exception can be thrown in two circumstances.
 * <ol>
 * <li>It can be thrown in a replicated environment when the Replica has been
 * upgraded to contain new persistent classes that define a new primary or
 * secondary index, but the Master has not yet been upgraded.  The index does
 * not exist because the Master has not yet been upgraded with the new classes.
 * If the application is aware of when the Master is upgraded, it can wait for
 * that to occur and then open the index. Or, the application may repeatedly
 * try to open the index until it becomes available.</li>
 * <li>
 * <!-- end JE only -->
 * <p>It can be thrown when opening an environment read-only with new
 * persistent classes that define a new primary or secondary index.  The index
 * does not exist because the environment has not yet been opened read-write
 * with the new classes.  When the index is created by a read-write
 * application, the read-only application must close and re-open the
 * environment in order to open the new index.</p>
