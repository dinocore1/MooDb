/**
 * The interface implemented for extracting single-valued secondary keys from
 * primary records.
 *
 * <p>The key creator object is specified by calling {@link
 * SecondaryConfig#setKeyCreator SecondaryConfig.setKeyCreator}. The secondary
 * database configuration is specified when calling {@link
 * Environment#openSecondaryDatabase Environment.openSecondaryDatabase}.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     class MyKeyCreator implements SecondaryKeyCreator {
 *         public boolean createSecondaryKey(SecondaryDatabase secondary,
 *                                             DatabaseEntry key,
 *                                             DatabaseEntry data,
 *                                             DatabaseEntry result) {
 *             //
 *             // DO HERE: Extract the secondary key from the primary key and
 *             // data, and set the secondary key into the result parameter.
 *             //
 *             return true;
 *         }
 *     }
 *     ...
 *     SecondaryConfig secConfig = new SecondaryConfig();
 *     secConfig.setKeyCreator(new MyKeyCreator());
 *     // Now pass secConfig to Environment.openSecondaryDatabase
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Use this interface when zero or one secondary key is present in a single
 * primary record, in other words, for many-to-one and one-to-one
 * relationships. When more than one secondary key may be present (for
 * many-to-many and one-to-many relationships), use the {@link
 * SecondaryMultiKeyCreator} interface instead.  The table below summarizes how
 * to create all four variations of relationships.</p>
 * <div>
 * <table border="yes">
 *     <tr><th>Relationship</th>
 *         <th>Interface</th>
 *         <th>Duplicates</th>
 *         <th>Example</th>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr><td>One-to-one</td>
 *         <td>{@link SecondaryKeyCreator}</td>

 *     </tr>
 *     <tr><td>Many-to-one</td>
 *         <td>{@link SecondaryKeyCreator}</td>

 * <p><em>WARNING:</em> Key creator instances are shared by multiple threads

 * Therefore, key creators must be thread safe.  In general no shared state
