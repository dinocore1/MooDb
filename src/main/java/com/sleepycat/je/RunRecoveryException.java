/**
 * This base class of {@link EnvironmentFailureException} is deprecated but
 * exists for API backward compatibility.
 *
 * <p>Prior to JE 4.0, {@code RunRecoveryException} is thrown to indicate that
 * the JE environment is invalid and cannot continue on safely.  Applications
 * catching {@code RunRecoveryException} prior to JE 4.0 were required to close
 * and re-open the {@code Environment}.</p>
 *
 * <p>When using JE 4.0 or later, the application should catch {@link
 * EnvironmentFailureException}. The application should then call {@link
 * Environment#isValid} to determine whether the {@code Environment} must be
 * closed and re-opened, or can continue operating without being closed.  See
 * {@link EnvironmentFailureException}.</p>
 *
 * @deprecated replaced by {@link EnvironmentFailureException} and {@link
 * Environment#isValid}.
