 * ProgressListener provides feedback to the application that progress is being
 * made on a potentially long running or asynchronous JE operation. The
 * listener itself is general and abstract, and more details about the meaning
 * of the progress callback can be found by reading about the entry points
 * where specific ProgressListeners can be specified. For example, see:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@link PreloadConfig#setProgressListener}, which accepts a
 *  ProgressListener&lt;PreloadConfig.Phase&gt;, and reports on
 *  Environment.preload() or Database.preload()</li>

 * <li>{@link EnvironmentConfig#setRecoveryProgressListener}, which accepts a
 *  ProgressListener&lt;RecoveryProgress&gt;, and reports on environment
 *  startup.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicationConfig#setSyncupProgressListener},
 *  which accepts a ProgressListener&lt;SyncupProgress&gt;, and reports on
 *  replication stream syncup.
 * </li>
 * </ul>

     * Called by BDB JE to indicate to the user that progress has been
     * made on a potentially long running or asynchronous operation.
     * <p>
     * This method should do the minimal amount of work, queuing any resource
     * intensive operations for processing by another thread before returning
     * to the caller, so that it does not unduly delay the target operation,
     * which invokes this method.
     * <p>
     * The applicaton should also be aware that the method has potential to
     * disrupt the reported-upon operation. If the progress() throws a
     * RuntimeException, the operation for which the progress is being reported
     * will be aborted and the exception propagated back to the original
     * caller. Also, if progress() returns false, the operation will be
     * halted. For recovery and syncup listeners, a false return value can
     * invalidate and close the environment.
     *
     * @param phase an enum indicating the phase of the operation for
     * which progress is being reported.
     * @param n indicates the number of units that have been processed so far.
     * If this does not apply, -1 is returned.
     * @param total indicates the total number of units that will be processed
     * if it is known by JE.  If total is < 0, then the total number is
     * unknown.  When total == n, this indicates that processing of this
     * operation is 100% complete, even if all previous calls to progress
     * passed a negative value for total.
     *
     * @return true to continue the operation, false to stop it.
