/**
 * Thrown when multiple threads are competing for a lock and the lock timeout
 * interval is exceeded for the current thread.  This may be the result of a
 * deadlock or simply because a lock is held for longer than the timeout
 * interval.  The lock timeout interval may be set using {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#setLockTimeout} or {@link Transaction#setLockTimeout}.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Transaction} handle is invalidated as a result of this
 * exception.</p>
 *
 * <p>For compatibility with JE 3.3 and earlier, {@link DeadlockException} is
 * thrown instead of {@link LockTimeoutException} and {@link
 * TransactionTimeoutException} when {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#LOCK_OLD_LOCK_EXCEPTIONS} is set to true.  This
 * configuration parameter is false by default.  See {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#LOCK_OLD_LOCK_EXCEPTIONS} for information on the changes
 * that should be made to all applications that upgrade from JE 3.3 or
 * earlier.</p>
 *
 * <p>Normally, applications should catch the base class {@link
 * LockConflictException} rather than catching one of its subclasses.  All lock
 * conflicts are typically handled in the same way, which is normally to abort
 * and retry the transaction.  See {@link LockConflictException} for more
 * information.</p>
