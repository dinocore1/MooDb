Environment configuration parameter support.
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Attributes of Berkeley Db, Java Edition may be set programmatically or
through a properties file in the environment home directory. In
general, applications that want to set environment attributes 
will do so through the setter methods provided in configuration classes such
as com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentConfig.
<p>
Occasionally the application will choose to set a less frequently used
attribute through EnvironmentConfig.setConfigParam(). The classes in
this package are used with that method.
