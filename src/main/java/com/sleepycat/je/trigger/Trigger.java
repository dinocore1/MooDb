/**
 * <code>Trigger</code> defines the trigger methods associated with a database.
 * They provide a mechanism to track the database definition operations used to
 * manage the lifecycle of the database itself, as well as the record
 * operations used to modify the contents of the database.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: Only transient triggers are currently supported, and the
 * documention below has not yet been updated to reflect this fact.  The bottom
 * line is that triggers are currently only useful and known to be reliable for
 * maintaining a cache of database information on a replica, where the cache is
 * initialized after opening the database (and configuring the trigger), and
 * where only the TransactionTrigger.commit method is used.  More specifically:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Although the {@link PersistentTrigger} interface exists, it may not
 *  currently be used reliably.</li>
 *  <li>Triggers must be configured on each node in a rep group separately,
 *  when needed.  Specifically, a trigger configured on a master will not be
 *  automatically configured and invoked on the replicas in the group.</li>
 *  <li>Because only transient triggers are currently supported, trigger
 *  methods are only called after opening a database (when configuring the
 *  trigger in the DatabaseConfig), and are not called after closing the
 *  database.</li>
 *  <li>As a result of the above point, triggers are not called during
 *  recovery, and therefore cannot be reliably used to perform write operations
 *  using the tranaction passed to the trigger method.</li>
 *  <li>Also see the warning at the top of ReplicatedDatabaseTrigger.java.</li>
 *  </ul>
 * <p>
 * The trigger methods {@link #put put} and {@link #delete delete} are used to
 * track all record operations on the database.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A trigger method takes a transaction as its first argument. If the
 * environment is not transactional, the argument is null. In all other cases,
 * it's a valid transaction ({@link Transaction#isValid() Transaction.isValid}
 * is true) and the trigger can use this transaction to make it's own set of
 * accompanying changes.
 * <p>
 * If the invocation of a trigger results in a runtime exception, the
 * transaction (if one was associated with the method) is invalidated and any
 * subsequent triggers associated with the operation are skipped. It's the
 * caller's responsibility to handle the exception and abort the invalidated
 * transaction. If the exception is thrown during the replay of a transaction
 * on a replica in an HA application, the environment is invalidated and a new
 * environment handle must be created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A Trigger is associated with a database via
 * {@link DatabaseConfig#setTriggers DatabaseConfig.setTriggers}.
