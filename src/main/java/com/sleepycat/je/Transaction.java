/**
 * The Transaction object is the handle for a transaction.  Methods off the
 * transaction handle are used to configure, abort and commit the transaction.
 * Transaction handles are provided to other Berkeley DB methods in order to
 * transactionally protect those operations.
 *
 * <p>A single Transaction may be used to protect operations for any number of
 * Databases in a given environment.  However, a single Transaction may not be
 * used for operations in more than one distinct environment.</p>
 *
 * <p>Transaction handles are free-threaded; transactions handles may be used
 * concurrently by multiple threads. Once the {@link Transaction#abort
 * Transaction.abort} or {@link Transaction#commit Transaction.commit} method
 * is called, the handle may not be accessed again, regardless of the success
 * or failure of the method, with one exception:  the {@code abort} method may
 * be called any number of times to simplify error handling.</p>
 *
 * <p>To obtain a transaction with default attributes:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     Transaction txn = myEnvironment.beginTransaction(null, null);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>To customize the attributes of a transaction:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     TransactionConfig config = new TransactionConfig();
 *     config.setReadUncommitted(true);
 *     Transaction txn = myEnvironment.beginTransaction(null, config);
