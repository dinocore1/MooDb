Support for the Java Connector Architecture, which provides a standard
for connecting the J2EE platform to legacy enterprise information
systems (EIS), such as ERP systems, database systems, and legacy
applications not written in Java.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
Users who want to run JE within a J2EE Application Server can use the
JCA Resource Adapter to connect to JE through a standard API. The JE
Resource Adapter supports all three J2EE application server
transaction types:
</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>No transaction.
</li><li>Local transactions.
</li><li>XA transactions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
JCA also includes the Java Transaction API (JTA), which means that JE
supports 2 phase commit (XA).  Therefore, JE can participate
in distributed transactions managed by either a J2EE server or
the applications direct use of the JTA API.
