     * logged, a EnvironmentFailureException is thrown.
     *
     * Error conditions (in contrast to Exceptions) always result in the
     * environment being invalidated and the Error being propagated back to the
     * application.  In addition, if the environment is made invalid in another
     * thread, or the transaction is closed by another thread, then we
     * propagate the exception and we do not attempt to abort.  This special
     * handling is prior to the pre-commit stage.
     *
     * From an exception handling viewpoint the commit goes through two stages:
     * a pre-commit stage spanning steps 1-3, and a post-commit stage
     * spanning steps 4-5. The post-commit stage is entered only after a commit
     * entry has been successfully logged.
     *
     * Any exceptions detected during the pre-commit stage results in an
     * attempt to log an abort entry. A NULL commitLsn (and abortLsn)
     * indicates that we are in the pre-commit stage. Note in particular, that
     * if the log of the commit entry (step 3) fails due to an IOException,
     * then the lower levels are responsible for wrapping it in a
     * EnvironmentFailureException which is propagated directly to the
     * application.
     *
     * Exceptions thrown in the post-commit stage are examined to see if they
     * are expected and must be propagated back to the caller after completing
     * any pending cleanup; some replication exceptions fall into this
     * category. If the exception was unexpected, the environment is
     * invalidated and a EnvironmentFailureException is thrown instead. The
     * current implementation only allows propagation of exceptions from the
     * post-commit hook, since we do not expect exceptions from any of the
     * other post-commit operations.
     *
     * When there are multiple failures in commit(), we want the caller to
     * receive the first exception, to make the problem manifest. So an effort
     * is made to preserve that primary exception and propagate it instead of
     * any following, secondary exceptions. The secondary exception is always
     * logged in such a circumstance.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException via Transaction.commit if cursors are
     * open.
     *
     * @throws OperationFailureException via Transaction.commit if an
     * OperationFailureException occurred earlier and set the txn to
     * abort-only.
     *
     * Note that IllegalStateException should never be thrown by
     * Transaction.commit because of a closed txn, since Transaction.commit and
     * abort set the Transaction.txn to null and disallow subsequent method
     * calls (other than abort).  So in a sense the call to checkState(true) in
     * this method is unnecessary, although perhaps a good safeguard.

     *    use the same undo logic as recovery to undo the transaction. Note
     *    that we walk the log in order to undo in reverse order of the

     *       delete K1/D1 (in LN 10)
     *       create K1/D1 (in LN 20)
     *    If we process LN10 before LN 20, we'd inadvertently create a
     *    duplicate tree of "K1", which would be fatal for the mapping tree.
     * 4. Release the write lock for this LN.
     *
     * An abort differs from a rollback in that the former always undoes every
     * operation, and returns it to the pre-txn state. A rollback may return
     * the txn to an intermediate state, or to the pre-txn state.
