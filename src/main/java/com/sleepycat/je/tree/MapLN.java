/**
 * A MapLN represents a Leaf Node in the JE Db Mapping Tree.
 *
 * MapLNs contain a DatabaseImpl, which in turn contain three categories of
 * information - database configuration information, the per-database File
 * Summary utilization information, and each database's btree root. While LNs
 * are written to the log as the result of API operations which create new data
 * records, MapLNs are written to the log as a result of configuration changes,
 * utilization information changes, or updates to the btree which cascade up
 * the tree and result in a new root. Because they serve as a bridge between
 * the application data btree and the db mapping tree, MapLNs must be written
 * with special rules, and should only be written from DbTree.modifyDbRoot.
 * The basic rule is that in order to ensure that the MapLN contains the
 * proper btree root, the btree root latch is used to protect both any logging
 * of the MapLN, and any updates to the root lsn.
 *
 * Updates to the internal btree nodes obey a strict bottom up approach, in
 * accordance with the log semantics which require that later log entries are
 * known to supercede earlier log entries. In other words, for a btree that
 * looks like
 *      MapLN
 *        |
 *       IN
 *        |
 *       BIN
 *        |
 *       LN
 * we know that update operations cause the btree nodes must be logged in this
 * order: LN, BIN, IN, MapLN, so that the reference to each on disk node is
 * correct. (Note that logging order is special and different when the btree
 * is initially created.)
 *
 * However, MapLNs may need to be written to disk at arbitrary points in time
 * in order to save database config or utilization data. Those writes don't
 * have the time and context to be done in a cascading-upwards fashion.  We
 * ensure that MapLNs are not erroneously written with an out of sync root by
 * requiring that DbTree.modifyDbRoot takes the root latch for the application
 * data btree. RootINs are also written with the root latch, so it serves to
 * ensure that the root doesn't change during the time when the MapLN is
 * written. For example, suppose thread 1 is doing a cascading-up MapLN write,
 * and thread 2 is doing an arbitrary-point MapLN write:
 *
 * Thread 1                   Thread 2
 * --------                   --------
 * latch root                 latch BIN parent of MapLN
 * log root IN
 * log MapLN (Tree root)       wants to log MapLN too -- but has to take
 *  to refer to new root IN    root latch, so we'll get the right rootIN
 *
 * Without latching the root this could produce the following, incorrect log
 *  30 LNa
 *  40 BIN
 *  50 IN (first version of root)
 *  60 MapLN, refers to IN(50)
 *  ...
 *  90 LNb
 *  100 BIN
 *  110 IN (second version of root)
 *  120 CkptStart (the tree is not dirty, no IN will be logged during the
 *   ckpt interval))
 *   ..  something arbirarily writes out the MapLN
 *  130 MapLN refers to first root, IN(50)    <------ impossible
 *
 * While a MapLN can't be written out with the wrong root, it's possible
 * for a rootIN to be logged without the MapLN, and for that rootIN not
 * to be processed at recovery. Suppose a checkpoint begins and ends
 * in the window between when a rootIN is written, and DbTree.modifyDbRoot is
 * called:
 *   300 log new root IN,
 *   update root reference in tree
 *   unlatch root
 *
 *   310 Checkpoint starts
 *   320 Checkpoint ends
 *   ...if we crash here, before the MapLN is logged, , we won't see the new
 *   root IN at lsn 300. However, the IN is non-txnal and will be recreated
 *   during reply of txnal information (LNs) by normal recovery processing.
