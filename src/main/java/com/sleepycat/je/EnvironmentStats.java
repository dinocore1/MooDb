 * Viewing the stats with {@link EnvironmentStats#toStringVerbose()} will

 * <p>
 * The current categories are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>IO</b>: Log file opens, reads, writes, cache misses.</li>
 * <li><b>Cache</b>: Data, keys, internal btree nodes, locks and JE metadata
 * reside in the cache. If the cache is too full, nodes, data and keys are
 * periodically evicted to stay within the defined cache size.</li>
 * <li><b>Log Cleaning</b>: Maintenance of JE's append only storage system.
 * See this <a href="{@docRoot}/../GettingStartedGuide/logfilesrevealed.html">
 * overview</a> of the logging system. Log files are removed as their
 * contents become obsolete.</li>
 * <li><b>Node Compression</b>: Internal btree nodes are compressed and removed
 * when their contents become sparse. </li>
 * <li><b>Checkpoints</b>: The frequency and extent of checkpointing activity.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Environment</b>: Miscellaneous environment wide statistics.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Locks</b>: Number of locking operations, contention on lock table.
