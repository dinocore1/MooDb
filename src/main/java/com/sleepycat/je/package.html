Foundation for creating environments, databases and transactions; provides
cursor based data access.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
This package constitutes the base public API for Berkeley DB, Java
Edition. The classes here are used to create database
objects, and insert and retrieve data.
<p>
This package provides a key/data pair model of a database
record. Databases and database cursors are the key objects used to
access data. An alternative collections based API is available through 
com.sleepycat.collections.
<p>
The Environment class embodies the database environment and is the starting
point for the application. Databases and transaction objects are
created through the Environment class.
<p>
Data can be inserted and retrieved directly through the Database
object, or through a Cursor obtained from the Database. A database record
consist of a key/data pair, where key and data are each individually
represented by a DatabaseEntry object. Classes in com.sleepycat.bind
provide optional support for mapping a Java object to a DatabaseEntry.
<p>
Configuration classes are used to specify the attributes of particular
operations. For example the attributes of a database environment are
specified in the EnvironmentConfig class. An instance of that class is
required for Environment construction. Likewise, the attributes of a
database are described in DatabaseConfig, which is a parameter to the
Environment.openDatabase() method.
