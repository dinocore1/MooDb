/**
 * An asynchronous mechanism for tracking the {@link
 * ReplicatedEnvironment.State State} of the replicated environment and
 * choosing how to route database operations.  {@code State} determines which
 * operations are currently permitted on the node. For example, only the {@link
 * ReplicatedEnvironment.State#MASTER MASTER} node can execute write
 * operations.
 * <p>
 * The Listener is registered with the replicated environment using {@link
 * ReplicatedEnvironment#setStateChangeListener(StateChangeListener)}.  There
 * is at most one Listener associated with the actual environment (not an
 * {@link com.sleepycat.je.Environment} handle) at any given instance in time.
 * <p>
 * {@literal See} the {@link <a
 * href="{@docRoot}/../examples/je/rep/quote/package-summary.html">
 * examples</a>} for information on different approaches toward routing
 * database operations and an example of using the StateChangeListener.
