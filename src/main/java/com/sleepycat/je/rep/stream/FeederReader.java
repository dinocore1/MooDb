 * stream feeding. It assumes that reading will always go forward in the log.
 * Special features are:
 *
 * - The reader can read either from a log buffer or from the file. Sometimes
 *   log entries are logged but are not yet available on disk. In general, it's
 *   better to read from the log buffers rather then the file.
 *
 * - The reader can block for a given time period, waiting for the next vlsn to
