/**
 * A utility to reset the members of a replication group, replacing the group
 * with a new group consisting of a single new member as described by the
 * arguments supplied to the utility.
 * <p>
 * This utility is useful when a copy of an existing replicated environment
 * needs to be used at a different site, with the same data, but with a
 * different initial node that can be used to grow the replication group as
 * usual. The utility can also be used to change the group name associated with
 * the environment.
 * <p>
 * The reset environment has a different identity from the environment before
 * the reset operation although it contains the same application data. To avoid
 * confusion, the reset environment is assigned a new internal unique id. The
 * unique id is checked whenever nodes attempt to communicate with each other
 * and ensure that all nodes in a group are dealing with the same data.
 * <p>
 * The reset process is typically accomplished using the steps outlined below.
 * It's good practice to back up your environment before running any utilities
 * that modify an environment.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Use {@code DbResetRepGroup} to reset an existing environment.
 * {@code DbResetRepGroup} can be used as a command line utility, and must be
 * executed locally on the host specified in the -nodeHostPort argument. The
 * host must also contain the the environment directory.
 * Alternatively, {@code DbResetRepGroup} may be used programmatically through
 * the provided APIs.</li>
 * <li>Once reset, the environment can be opened with a
 * {@code ReplicatedEnvironment}, using the same node configuration as the one
 * that was pass in to the utility. No helper host configuration is needed.
 * Since the group consists of a single node, it will assume the role of a
 * Master.
 * <li>Additional nodes may now be created and can join the group as newly
 * created replicas, as described in {@code ReplicatedEnvironment}. Since these
 * new nodes are empty, they should be configured to use the new master as
 * their helper node, and will go through the
 * {@link <a href="{@docRoot}/../ReplicationGuide/lifecycle.html#lifecycle-nodestartup"> replication node lifecycle</a>}
 * to populate their environment directories. In this case, there will be data
 * in the converted master that can only be transferred to the replica through
 * a file copy executed with the help of a
 * {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.NetworkRestore}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * // Run the utility on a copy of an existing replicated environment. Usually
 * // this environment will have originated on a different node and its
 * // replication group information will contain meta data referring to its
 * // previous host. The utility will reset this metadata so that it has a
 * // rep group (UniversalRepGroup) with a single node named nodeMars. The node
 * // is associated with the machine mars and will communicate on port 5001.
 *
 * DbResetRepGroup resetUtility =
 *     new DbResetRepGroup(envDirMars,          // env home dir
 *                         "UniversalRepGroup", // group name
 *                         "nodeMars",          // node name
 *                         "mars:5001");        // node host,port
 * resetUtility.reset();
 *
 * // Open the reset environment; it will take on the role of master.
 * ReplicatedEnvironment nodeMars = new ReplicatedEnvironment(envDirMars, ...);
 * ...
 * // Bring up additional nodes, which will be initialized from
 * // nodeMars. For example, from the machine venus you can now add a new
 * // member to the group(UniversalRepGroup) as below.
 *
 * ReplicationConfig repConfig = null;
 * try {
 *     repConfig = new ReplicationConfig("UniversalRepGroup", // groupName
 *                                       "nodeVenus",         // nodeName
 *                                       "venus:5008");       // nodeHostPort
 *     repConfig.setHelperHosts("mars:5001");
 *
 *     nodeVenus = new ReplicatedEnvironment(envDirB, repConfig, envConfig);
 * } catch (InsufficientLogException insufficientLogEx) {
 *
 *     // log files will be copied from another node in the group
 *     NetworkRestore restore = new NetworkRestore();
 *     restore.execute(insufficientLogEx, new NetworkRestoreConfig());
 *
 *     // try opening the node now that the environment files have been
 *     // restored on this machine.
 *     nodeVenus = new ReplicatedEnvironment(envDirVenus,
 *                                           repConfig,
