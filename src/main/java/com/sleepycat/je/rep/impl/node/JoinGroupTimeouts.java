/**
 * Encapsulates the handling of timeouts: ENV_SETUP_TIMEOUT and
 * ENV_UNKNOWN_STATE_TIMEOUT, used when a replicated environment handle is
 * opened and a node joins the group.
 * <p>
 * There are three timeouts that are relevant at the time a Replica joins a
 * group. They are listed below in the order in which each is applied.
 *
 * 1) The ENV_UNKNOWN_STATE_TIMEOUT which is basically an election timeout. If
 * set and an election is not concluded in this time period, the environment
 * handle is opened in the unknown state.
 *
 * 2) The ENV_SETUP_TIMEOUT. This timeout determines the maximum amount of time
 * allowed to hold an election and sync up with a master if the joins as a
 * replica.
 *
 * 3) The consistency timeout as determined by the consistency policy in the
 * event that the node joins as a replica.
 *
 * The first two timeouts are managed by this class. RepNode.joinGroup uses the
 * timeouts supplied by the getTimeout() method to wait for each timeout if
 * both are specified.
 *
 * joinGroup first waits up to the unknown state timeout for an election to be
 * concluded. If the node is not in the unknown state at the timeout,
 * it advances to the env setup timeout by invoking setSetupTimeout() and
 * proceeds to wait up to this timeout for the syncup activity to complete.
 *
