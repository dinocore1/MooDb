/**
 * Ensures that a VLSN is not advanced at this node while an election is in
 * progress. Note that this is difficult, if not impossible to achieve
 * efficiently in a distributed environment across the entire group, when
 * communications may not always be reliable. So, the implementation really
 * represents a good faith effort to freeze the VLSN. JE HA itself should be
 * able to make forward progress in the event of such a failure.
 *
 * The class coordinates three threads: the acceptor, the learner, and the
 * replay thread. There is exactly one instance of each thread per replication
 * node, so it coordinates the activity of these three threads.
 *
 * The typical serialized sequence of calls is therefore:
 *
 * latch.freeze() -- invoked in response to a Promise by an Acceptor
 * latch.vlsnEvent() -- one or more of them in response to ongoing election
 * latch.awaitThaw() -- by the replica thread waiting for the freeze to lift
 *
 * Both vlsnEvent() and awaitThaw() are NOPs in the absence of a freeze.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://sleepycat.oracle.com/trac/wiki/ElectionsImplementation#FreezingVLSNs">Freezing VLSNs</a>
