 * periodically checked to ensure that they are active. The period roughly
 * corresponds to a second, although intervening GC activity may expand this
 * period considerably. Note that elapsedMs used for timeouts is always ticked
 * up in 1 second increments. Thus multiple seconds of real time may correspond
 * to a single second of "timer time" if the system is paricularly busy, or the
 * gc has been particularly active.
 *
 * This property allows the underlying timeout implementation to compensate for
 * GC pauses in which activity on the channel at the java level would have been
 * suspended and thus reduces the number of false timeouts.
