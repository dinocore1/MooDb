     * transaction are marked obsolete.
     *
     * Note that this is by no means a complete implementation of what would be
     * needed to support user visible savepoints. This method only rolls back
     * write operations and doesn't handle other types of state, like read
     * locks and open cursors.
     *
     * There are several key assumptions:
     * - the transaction does not hold read locks.
     * - the transaction will either be resumed, and any rolled back
     * operations will be repeated, or the transaction will be aborted
     * in its entirety.
     *
     * If all operations in the transaction are rolled back, this transaction
     * is also unregistered and closed.
     *
     * Rolling back a log entry through rollback is akin to truncating the
     * transactional log. The on-disk entries should not be referred to by
     * anything in the in-memory tree or the transaction chain. JE's append
     * only storage and the fact that the transactional log entries are
     * intertwined through the physical log prohibits any log truncation. To
     * mimic log truncation, any rolled back log entry is marked as
     * obsolete. Since only the last version of any data record is alive,
     * any future uses of this transaction must use the obsoleteDupsAllowed
     * option (see Txn.countObsoleteExact) to prevent asserts about duplicate
     * obsolete offsets. For example, suppose the transaction logs this:
     *
     * 100 LNa (version1)
     * 200 LNa (version2)
     * 300 LNa (version3)
     *
     * At this point in time, LSN 100 and 200 are obsolete.
     *
     * Now, suppose we roll back to LSN 100. LSNs 200 and 300 are marked
     * obsolete by the rollback.(although LSN 200 was already obsolete).  It is
     * true that for an instance in time LSN 100 is incorrectly marked as
     * obsolete, when it's really alive. But this transaction is going to
     * either abort or resume exactly as it was before, so LSN 100 is going to
     * be obsolete again.
     *
     * Suppose txn.abort() is called. The abort() logic will mark LSN 100 as
     * obsolete, since it is the latest version of the record in the
     * transaction. Using the obsoleteDupsAllowed option avoids an assertion on
     * the double recording of LSN 100.
     *
     * Alternatively, suppose LNa (version2) is retransmitted and logged as LSN
     * 400. Normal execution of LN.log() marks LSN 100 as obsolete, which would
     * trigger the assertion were it not for obsoleteDupsAllowed.

     *   500 (B) rolls back to 200
