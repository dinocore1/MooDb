/**
 * A replicated database environment that is a node in a replication
 * group. Please read the {@link <a
 * href="{@docRoot}/../ReplicationGuide/introduction.html">Berkeley DB JE High
 * Availability Overview</a>} for an introduction to basic concepts and key
 * terminology.
 * <p>
 * Berkeley DB JE High Availability (JE HA) is a replicated, embedded database
 * management system which provides fast, reliable, and scalable data
 * management. JE HA enables replication of an environment across a Replication
 * Group. A ReplicatedEnvironment is a single node in the replication group.
 * <p>
 * ReplicatedEnvironment extends {@link Environment}. All database operations
 * are executed in the same fashion in both replicated and non replicated
 * applications, using {@link Environment} methods.  A ReplicatedEnvironment
 * must be transactional. All databases created in the replicated environment
 * must be transactional as well.
 * <p>
 * ReplicatedEnvironment handles are analogous to {@link Environment}
 * handles. A replicated environment handle is a ReplicatedEnvironment
 * instance; multiple ReplicatedEnvironment instances may be created for the
 * same physical directory. In other words, more than one ReplicatedEnvironment
 * handle may be open at a time for a given environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A ReplicatedEnvironment joins its replication group when it is instantiated.
 * When the constructor returns, the node will have established contact with
 * the other members of the group and will be ready to service operations. The
 * {@link <a href="{@docRoot}/../ReplicationGuide/lifecycle.html">life
 * cycle</a>} overview is useful for understanding replication group creation.
 * <p>
 * The membership of a replication group is dynamically defined. The group
 * comes into being when ReplicatedEnvironments that are configured as members
 * of a group are created and discover each other. ReplicatedEnvironments are
 * identified by a group name, a node name, and a hostname:port
 * value. Membership information is stored in an internal, replicated database
 * available to all nodes.
 * <p>
 * To start a node and join a group, instantiate a ReplicatedEnvironment. The
 * very first instantiation of a node differs slightly from all future
 * instantiations. A brand new, empty node does not yet have access to the
 * membership database, so it must discover the group with the aid of a
 * helper node, which is a fellow member. If this is the very first node of the
 * entire group, there is no available helper. Instead, the helper host address
 * to use is the node's own address. The example below takes the simple
 * approach of creating a replication group by starting up a node that will act
 * as the first master, though it is not necessary to follow this order.
 * {@link <a
 * href="{@docRoot}/../ReplicationGuide/progoverview.html#configrepenv">
 * Configuring Replicated Environments</a>} describes group startup in greater
 * detail.
 * <p>
 * To create the <b>the master node in a brand new group</b>, instantiate a
 * ReplicatedEnvironment this way:
 * <pre class="code">
 * EnvironmentConfig envConfig = new EnvironmentConfig();
 * envConfig.setAllowCreate(true);
 * envConfig.setTransactional(true);
 *
 * // Identify the node
 * ReplicationConfig repConfig = new ReplicationConfig();
 * repConfig.setGroupName("PlanetaryRepGroup");
 * repConfig.setNodeName("Mercury");
 * repConfig.setNodeHostPort("mercury.acme.com:5001");
 *
 * // This is the first node, so its helper is itself
 * repConfig.setHelperHosts("mercury.acme.com:5001");
 *
 * ReplicatedEnvironment repEnv =
 *     new ReplicatedEnvironment(envHome, repConfig, envConfig);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * To create a new node when there are <b>other existing group members</b>,
 * set a helper address which points to an existing node in the group. A simple
 * way to bring up a new group is to "chain" the new nodes by having the
 * helpers reference a previously created node.
 * <pre class="code">
 * EnvironmentConfig envConfig = new EnvironmentConfig();
 * envConfig.setAllowCreate(true);
 * envConfig.setTransactional(true);
 *
 * // Identify the node
 * ReplicationConfig repConfig =
 *     new ReplicationConfig("PlanetaryRepGroup", "Jupiter", "jupiter.acme.com:5002");
 *
 * // Use the node at mercury.acme.com:5001 as a helper to find the rest
 * // of the group.
 * repConfig.setHelperHosts("mercury.acme.com:5001");
 *
 * ReplicatedEnvironment repEnv =
 *     new ReplicatedEnvironment(envHome, repConfig, envConfig);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In these examples, node Mercury was configured as its own helper, and
 * becomes the first master. The next nodes were configured to use Mercury as
 * their helper, and became replicas. It is also possible to start these in
 * reverse order, bringing mercury up last. In that case, the earlier nodes
 * will block until a helper is awake and can service their requests for group
 * metadata.
 * <p>
 * Creating a ReplicatedEnvironment for an <b>existing environment</b> requires
 * less configuration. The call
 * to {@code EnvironmentConfig.setAllowCreate()} is eliminated to guard
 * against the unintentional creation of a new environment. Also, there is no
 * need to set a helper host address, because the environment exists and has
 * access to the shared, persistent membership information.
 * <pre class="code">
 * EnvironmentConfig envConfig = new EnvironmentConfig();
 * envConfig.setTransactional(true);
 * ReplicationConfig repConfig =
 *     new ReplicationConfig("PlanetaryRepGroup", "Mercury", "mercury.acme.com:5001");
 *
 * ReplicatedEnvironment repEnv =
 *     new ReplicatedEnvironment(envHome, repConfig, envConfig);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * {@literal See} {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.util.ReplicationGroupAdmin
 * ReplicationGroupAdmin} for information on how to remove nodes from the
 * replication group.
 *
 * <p>
 * ReplicatedEnvironment properties can be set via the the {@literal
 * <environmentHome>/}je.properties file, just like {@link Environment}
 * properties. They follow the same property value precedence rules.
 *
 * <p>
 * A replicated environment directory can only be accessed by a read write
 * ReplicatedEnvironment handle or a read only {@link Environment} handle.  In
 * the current release, there is an additional restriction that a read only
 * {@link Environment} is only permitted when the directory is not also
 * accessed from a different process by a read/write ReplicatedEnvironment. If
 * a read/write ReplicatedEnvironment and a read only {@link Environment} from
 * two different processes concurrently access an environment directory, there
 * is the small possibility that the read only {@link Environment} may see
 * see exceptions thrown about an inconsistent log if the ReplicatedEnvironment
 * executes certain kinds of failover. There is no problem if the {@link
 * Environment} and ReplicatedEnvironment are in the same process, or are not
 * concurrent.
 * <p>
 * JE HA prohibits opening a replicated environment directory with a read/write
 * {@link Environment} handle, because from the group's perspective,
 * unreplicated updates to a single node would cause data inconsistency.  To
 * use an existing, non-replicated environment to bootstrap a replication
 * group, use {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.util.DbEnableReplication} to do a one
 * time conversion of the directory.
 * <p>
 * All other database objects, such as {@link com.sleepycat.je.Database} or
 * {@link com.sleepycat.je.Cursor} (when using the Base API) or {@link
 * com.sleepycat.persist.EntityStore} or {@link
 * com.sleepycat.persist.PrimaryIndex} (when using the Direct Persistence
 * Layer) should be created, used and closed before calling {@link
 * ReplicatedEnvironment#close}.

    /**
     * Creates a replicated environment handle and starts participating in the
     * replication group as either a Master or a Replica. The node's state is
     * determined when it joins the group, and mastership is not preconfigured.
     * If the group has no current master, creation of a handle will trigger an
     * election to determine whether this node will participate as a Master or
     * a Replica.
     * <p>
     * If the node participates as a Master, the constructor will return after
     * a sufficient number of Replicas, in accordance with the
     * {@code initialElectionPolicy} argument, have established contact with
     * the Master.
     * <p>
     * If the node participates as a Replica, it will become consistent in
     * accordance with the {@code consistencyPolicy} argument before returning
     * from the constructor.
     * <p>
     * If an election cannot be concluded in the time period defined by {@link
     * ReplicationConfig#ENV_SETUP_TIMEOUT}, by default it will throw an {@code
     * UnknownMasterException}. This behavior can be overridden via the {@link
     * ReplicationConfig#ENV_UNKNOWN_STATE_TIMEOUT} to permit the creation of
     * the handle in the {@link State#UNKNOWN} state. A handle in UNKNOWN state
     * can be used to service read operations with an appropriately relaxed
     * consistency policy.
     * <p>
     * A brand new node will always join an existing group as a Replica, unless
     * it is the very first node that is creating the group. In that case it
     * joins as the Master of the newly formed singleton group. A brand new
     * node must always specify one or more active helper nodes via the
     * {@link ReplicationConfig#setHelperHosts(String)} method, or via the the
     * <code>&lt;environment home&gt;/je.properties</code> file. If this is the
     * very first member of a nascent group, it must specify just itself as the
     * helper.
     * <p>
     * There are special considerations to keep in mind when a replication
     * group is started and elections are first held to determine a master. The
     * default {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.QuorumPolicy#SIMPLE_MAJORITY} calls
     * for a simple majority vote. If the group members were previously created
     * and populated, the default election policy may result in the election of
     * a master that may not have the most up to date copy of the environment.
     * This could happen if the best qualified node is slow to start up; it's
     * possible that by the time it's ready to participate in an election, the
     * election has already have completed with a simple majority.
     * <p>
     * To avoid this possibility, the method has a parameter
     * initialElectionPolicy, which can be used to specify
     * {@link com.sleepycat.je.rep.QuorumPolicy#ALL}, which will cause the
     * elections to wait until all nodes can vote. By ensuring that all the
     * nodes can vote, the best possible node is chosen to be the master at
     * group startup.
     * <p>
     * Note that it is the application's responsibility to ensure that all
     * nodes coordinate their choice of initialElectionPolicy so that the very
     * first elections held when a group is brought up use the same value for
     * this parameter. This parameter is only used for the first election.
     * After the first election has been held and the group is functioning,
     * subsequent elections do not require participation of all the nodes. A
     * simple majority is sufficient to elect the node with the most up to date
     * environment as the master.

     * the time that the commit thread is still awaiting
     * acknowledgments.  If the candidate replicas are working
     * through a long backlog after having been disconnected, this can
     * take some time, so the timeout value should be chosen to allow
     * for this possibility.
     * 
     * <li>The master blocks new transactions from being committed or

     * 
     * <li>The master now waits for one of the candidate replicas to
     * become fully current (completely caught up with the end of the
     * log on the master).  The first replica that becomes current is
     * the one that is chosen to become the new master.  This second
     * wait period is expected to be brief, since it only has to wait
     * until transactions that were committed in the interval between
     * step 1) and step 2) have been acknowledged by a replica.
     *
     * <li>The master sends messages to all other nodes announcing the chosen
     * replica as the new master. This results in the environment at the
     * current master being invalidated. Any subsequent attempt to use this
     * environment will result in a {@code MasterReplicaTransitionException}
     * and the 
     * application will need to handle the exception as usual by closing and
     * re-establishing the environment handle.

     * step 2) allowing them to proceed. The released transactions will fail
