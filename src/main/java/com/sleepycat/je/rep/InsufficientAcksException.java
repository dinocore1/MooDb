/**
 * <p>
 * This exception is thrown at the time of a commit in a Master, if the Master
 * could not obtain transaction commit acknowledgments from its Replicas in
 * accordance with the {@link ReplicaAckPolicy} currently in effect. This
 * exception will never be thrown when the ReplicaAckPolicy of NONE is in
 * effect.
 * <p>
 * Note that a InsufficientAcksException does not indicate there was a failure
 * to commit the transaction on the master. The transaction has in fact been
 * successfully committed on the master at the time of the exception.
 * <p>
 * The application can handle the exception and use it to take some form of
 * administrative action. For example, it may log messages to have the
 * operations staff look into the health of the replicas or the network. Or it
 * may decide to increase the durability of the transaction on the Master by
 * ensuring that the changes are flushed to the operating system's buffers or
 * to the disk itself.
 * <p>
 * The application may additionally choose to continue to create new
 * transactions, which may succeed or fail depending on whether the underlying
 * problems have been resolved.
