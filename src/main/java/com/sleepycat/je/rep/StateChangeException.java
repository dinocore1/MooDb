 * Provides a synchronous mechanism for informing an application about a change

 * class, with subtypes for each type of Transition.
 * <p>
 * A single state change can result in multiple state change exceptions (one
 * per thread operating against the environment). Each exception is associated
 * with the event that provoked the exception. The application can use this
 * association to ensure that each such event is processed just once.
