/**
 * Represents the environment in which elections are run on behalf of a node.
 * There is exactly one instance of an Elections for each node. Elections are
 * initiated via this class.
 *
 * One of the primary goals of this interface is to keep Elections as free
 * standing as possible, so that we can change how elections are held, or
 * aspects of the election infrastructure with minimal impact on replication.
 * For example, elections currently used tcp for communication of election
 * messages but may want to switch over to udp. Such a change should be
 * confined to just the Elections module. Other changes might include changes
 * to the strategy used to suggest Values and the weight associated with a
 * suggested Value.
 *
 * The following are the principal points of interaction between Elections and
 * Replication:
 *
 * 1) The initiation of elections via the initiateElections() method.
 *
 * 2) The suggestion of nodes as masters and the ranking of the
 * suggestion. This is done via the Acceptor.SuggestionGenerator interface. An
 * instance of this interface is supplied when the Elections class is
 * instantiated. Note that the implementation must also initiate a freeze of
 * VLSNs to ensure that the ranking does not change as the election
 * progresses. The VLSN can make progress when the node is informed via its
 * Listener that an election with a higher Proposal number (than the one in the
 * Propose request) has finished.
 *
 * 3) Obtaining the result of an election initiated in step 1. This is done via
 * the Learner.Listener interface. An instance of this class is supplied when
 * the Election class is first instantiated.
