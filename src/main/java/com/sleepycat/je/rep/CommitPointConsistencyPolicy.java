/**
 * A consistency policy which ensures that the environment on a Replica node is
 * at least as current as denoted by the specified {@link CommitToken}. This
 * token represents a point in the serialized transaction schedule created by
 * the master. In other words, this token is like a bookmark, representing a
 * particular transaction commit in the replication stream. The Replica ensures
 * that the commit identified by the {@link CommitToken} has been executed on
 * this node before allowing the application's {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.Environment#beginTransaction(com.sleepycat.je.Transaction,
 * com.sleepycat.je.TransactionConfig) Environment.beginTransaction()}
 * operation on the Replica to proceed.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose the application is a web application where a replicated
 * group is implemented within a load balanced web server group. Each request
 * to the web server consists of an update operation followed by read
 * operations (say from the same client), The read operations naturally expect
 * to see the data from the updates executed by the same request. However, the
 * read operations might have been routed to a node that did not execute the
 * update.
 * <p>
 * In such a case, the update request would generate a {@link CommitToken},
 * which would be resubmitted by the browser, along with subsequent read
 * requests. The read request could be directed at any one of the available web
 * servers by a load balancer. The node which executes the read request would
 * create a CommitPointConsistencyPolicy with that {@link CommitToken} and use
 * it at transaction begin. If the environment at the web server was already
 * current (wrt the commit token), it could immediately execute the transaction
 * and satisfy the request. If not, the "transaction begin" would stall until
 * the Replica replay had caught up and the change was available at that web
 * server.
 * <p>
 * Consistency policies are specified at either a per-transaction level through
 * {@link com.sleepycat.je.TransactionConfig#setConsistencyPolicy} or as an
 * replication node wide default through {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.rep.ReplicationConfig#setConsistencyPolicy}
 *
