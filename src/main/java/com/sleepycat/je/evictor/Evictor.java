/**
 * The Evictor is responsible for maintaining the JE cache. Since object sizes
 * are not directly manipulated in a Java application, the cache is actually a
 * collection of in-memory btree nodes, implemented by
 * com.sleepycat.je.dbi.INList. Nodes are selected from the INList for removal,
 * which is done by detaching them from the in-memory tree, and by removing
 * them from the INList. Once all references to them are removed, they can be
 * GC'd by the JVM.
 *
 * There are three main components. 
 *
 * Arbiter: queries the memory budget to decide whether eviction is needed
 * TargetSelector : chooses a target node
 * Evictor: does the work of detaching the node.
 *
 * The TargetSelector and Evictor classes are subclassed to provide
 * private/shared cache implementations. A shared cache is used by multiple
 * environments within a single JVM, and is seen logically as a single INList
 * collection, although it is implemented by an umbrella over multiple INLists.
 *
 * The Evictor owns a thread pool which is available to handle eviction tasks. 
 * Eviction is carried out by three types of threads:
 * 1. The application thread, in the course of doing critical eviction
 * 2. Daemon threads, such as the cleaner or INCompressor, in the course of
 *    doing their respective duties
 * 3. Eviction pool threads
 *
 * We prefer that the eviction pool threads do as much of the eviction as 
 * possible, and that the application threads do as little, because eviction 
 * adds latency to the perceived application response time. To date, it has
 * been impossible to completely remove eviction responsiblities from the 
 * application threads, because the process doesn't have sufficient feedback,
 * and can incur an OutOfMemoryException.
 *
 * The eviction pool is a standard java.util.concurrent thread pool, and can
 * be mutably configured in terms of core threads, max threads, and keepalive
 * times.
 *
 * Since three types of threads can concurrently do eviction, it's important
 * that eviction is both thread safe and as parallel as possible.  Memory
 * thresholds are generally accounted for in an unsynchronized fashion, and are
 * seen as advisory. The only point of true synchronization is around the
 * selection of a node for eviction. The act of eviction itself can be done
 * concurrently.
 *
 * The eviction method is not reentrant, and a simple concurrent hash map
 * of threads is used to prevent recursive calls.
