/**
 * Record lock modes for read operations. Lock mode parameters may be specified
 * for all operations that retrieve data.
 *
 * <p><strong>Locking Rules</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>Together with {@link CursorConfig}, {@link TransactionConfig} and {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig} settings, lock mode parameters determine how records are
 * locked during read operations.  Record locking is used to enforce the
 * isolation modes that are configured.  Record locking is summarized below for
 * read and write operations.  For more information on isolation levels and
 * transactions, see <a
 * href="{@docRoot}/../TransactionGettingStarted/index.html"
 * target="_top">Writing Transactional Applications</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>With one exception, a record lock is always acquired when a record is
 * read or written, and a cursor will always hold the lock as long as it is
 * positioned on the record.  The exception is when {@link #READ_UNCOMMITTED}
 * is specified, which allows a record to be read without any locking.</p>
 *
 * <p>Both read (shared) and write (exclusive) locks are used.  Read locks are
 * normally acquired on read ({@code get} method} operations and write locks on
 * write ({@code put} method) operations.  However, a write lock will be
 * acquired on a read operation if {@link #RMW} is specified.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because read locks are shared, multiple accessors may read the same
 * record.  Because write locks are exclusive, if a record is written by one
 * accessor it may not be read or written by another accessor.  An accessor is
 * either a transaction or a thread (for non-transactional operations).</p>
 *
 * <p>Whether additional locking is performed and how locks are released depend
 * on whether the operation is transactional and other configuration
 * settings.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Transactional Locking</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>Transactional operations include all write operations for a transactional
 * database, and read operations when a non-null {@link Transaction} parameter
 * is passed.  When a null transaction parameter is passed for a write
 * operation for a transactional database, an auto-commit transaction is
 * automatically used.</p>
 *
 * <p>With transactions, read and write locks are normally held until the end
 * of the transaction (commit or abort).  Write locks are always held until the
 * end of the transaction.  However, if {@link #READ_COMMITTED} is configured,
 * then read locks for cursor operations are only held during the operation and
 * while the cursor is positioned on the record.  The read lock is released
 * when the cursor is moved to a different record or closed.  When {@link
 * #READ_COMMITTED} is used for a database (non-cursor) operation, the read
 * lock is released before the method returns.</p>
 *
 * <p>When neither {@link #READ_UNCOMMITTED} nor {@link #READ_COMMITTED} is
 * specified, read and write locking as described above provide Repeatable Read
 * isolation, which is the default transactional isolation level.  If
 * Serializable isolation is configured, additional "next key" locking is
 * performed to prevent "phantoms" -- records that are not visible at one point
 * in a transaction but that become visible at a later point after being
 * inserted by another transaction.  Serializable isolation is configured via
 * {@link TransactionConfig#setSerializableIsolation} or {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#setTxnSerializableIsolation}.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Non-Transactional Locking</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>Non-transactional operations include all operations for a
 * non-transactional database (including a Deferred Write database), and read
 * operations for a transactional database when a null {@link Transaction}
 * parameter is passed.</p>
 *
 * <p>For non-transactional operations, both read and write locks are only held
 * while a cursor is positioned on the record, and are released when the cursor
 * is moved to a different record or closed.  For database (non-cursor)
 * operations, the read or write lock is released before the method
 * returns.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This behavior is similar to {@link #READ_COMMITTED}, except that both
 * read and write locks are released.  Configuring {@link #READ_COMMITTED} for
 * a non-transactional database cursor has no effect.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because the current thread is the accessor (locker) for non-transactional
 * operations, a single thread may have multiple cursors open without locking
 * conflicts.  Two non-transactional cursors in the same thread may access the
 * same record via write or read operations without conflicts, and the changes
 * make by one cursor will be visible to the other cursor.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, a non-transactional operation will conflict with a transactional
 * operation for the same record even when performed in the same thread.  When
 * using a transaction in a particular thread for a particular database, to
 * avoid conflicts you should use that transaction for all access to that
 * database in that thread.  In other words, to avoid conflicts always pass the
 * transction parameter, not null, for all operations.  If you don't wish to
 * hold the read lock for the duration of the transaction, specify {@link
 * #READ_COMMITTED}.</p>
