 * Thrown when an attempt is made to delete a key from a foreign key database,
 * when that key is referenced by a secondary database, and the secondary is
 * configured to cause an abort in this situation.
 *
 * <p>When using the base API ({@code com.sleepycat.je}), this can occur when a
 * {@link SecondaryDatabase} is configured to be associated with a foreign key
 * database (see {@link SecondaryConfig#setForeignKeyDatabase}), and is also
 * configured with the {@link ForeignKeyDeleteAction#ABORT} delete action (see
 * {@link SecondaryConfig#setForeignKeyDeleteAction}).  Note that {@code ABORT}
 * is the default setting.</p>
 *
 * <p>When using the DPL ({@code com.sleepycat.persist}), this can occur when a
 * {@link com.sleepycat.persist.model.SecondaryKey} is defined with a {@link
 * com.sleepycat.persist.model.SecondaryKey#relatedEntity}, and {@link
 * com.sleepycat.persist.model.SecondaryKey#onRelatedEntityDelete} is {@link
 * com.sleepycat.persist.model.DeleteAction#ABORT} (which is the default).</p>
