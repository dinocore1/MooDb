/**
 * List of LSN offsets as a linked list of segments.  The reasons for using a
 * list of this type and not a java.util.List are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Segements reduce memory overhead by storing long primitives rather than
 * Long objects.  Many longs per segment reduce link overhead.</li>
 * <li>Memory is only allocated for new segments, reducing the number of calls
 * to update the memory budget.</li>
 * <li>This is an append-only list that supports a single appender thread and
 * multiple unsynchronized reader threads.  The caller is responsible for
 * synchronizing such that only one thread calls add() at one time.  The reader
 * threads see data as it is changing but do not see inconsistent data (corrupt
 * longs) and do not require synchronization for thread safety.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The algorithms here use traversal of the list segments rather than
 * recursion to avoid using a lot of stack space.</p>
