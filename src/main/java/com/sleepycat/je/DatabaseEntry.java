/**
 * Encodes database key and data items as a byte array.
 *
 * <p>Storage and retrieval for the {@link com.sleepycat.je.Database Database}
 * and {@link com.sleepycat.je.Cursor Cursor} methods are based on key/data
 * pairs. Both key and data items are represented by DatabaseEntry objects.
 * Key and data byte arrays may refer to arrays of zero length up to arrays of
 * essentially unlimited length.</p>
 *
 * <p>The DatabaseEntry class provides simple access to an underlying object
 * whose elements can be examined or changed.  DatabaseEntry objects can be
 * subclassed, providing a way to associate with it additional data or
 * references to other structures.</p>
 *
 * <p>Access to DatabaseEntry objects is not re-entrant. In particular, if
 * multiple threads simultaneously access the same DatabaseEntry object using
 * {@link com.sleepycat.je.Database Database} or {@link com.sleepycat.je.Cursor
 * Cursor} methods, the results are undefined.</p>
 *
 * <p>DatabaseEntry objects may be used in conjunction with the object mapping
 * support provided in the {@link com.sleepycat.bind} package.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Input and Output Parameters</h3>
 *
 * <p>DatabaseEntry objects are used for both input data (when writing to a
 * database or specifying a search parameter) and output data (when reading
 * from a database).  For certain methods, one parameter may be an input
 * parameter and another may be an output parameter.  For example, the {@link
 * Database#get} method has an input key parameter and an output data
 * parameter.  The documentation for each method describes whether its
 * parameters are input or output parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>For DatabaseEntry input parameters, the caller is responsible for
 * initializing the data array of the DatabaseEntry.  For DatabaseEntry output
 * parameters, the method called will initialize the data array.</p>
 *
 * <p>Also note that for DatabaseEntry output parameters, the method called
 * will always allocate a new byte array.  The byte array specified by the
 * caller will not be used.  Therefore, after calling a method that returns
 * output parameters, the application can safely keep a reference to the byte
 * array returned by {@link #getData} without danger that the array will be
 * overwritten in a subsequent call.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Offset and Size Properties</h3>
 *
 * <p>By default the Offset property is zero and the Size property is the
 * length of the byte array.  However, to allow for optimizations involving the
 * partial use of a byte array, the Offset and Size may be set to non-default
 * values.</p>
 *
 * <p>For DatabaseEntry output parameters, the Size will always be set to the
 * length of the byte array and the Offset will always be set to zero.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, for DatabaseEntry input parameters the Offset and Size are set
 * to non-default values by the built-in tuple and serial bindings.  For
 * example, with a tuple or serial binding the byte array is grown dynamically
 * as data is output, and the Size is set to the number of bytes actually used.
 * For a serial binding, the Offset is set to a non-zero value in order to
 * implement an optimization having to do with the serialization stream
 * header.</p>
 *
 * <p>Therefore, for output DatabaseEntry parameters the application can assume
 * that the Offset is zero and the Size is the length of the byte
 * array. However, for input DatabaseEntry parameters the application should
 * not make this assumption.  In general, it is safest for the application to
 * always honor the Size and Offset properties, rather than assuming they have
 * default values.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Partial Offset and Length Properties</h3>
 *
 * <p>By default the specified data (byte array, offset and size) corresponds
 * to the full stored key or data item.  Optionally, the Partial property can
 * be set to true, and the PartialOffset and PartialLength properties are used
 * to specify the portion of the key or data item to be read or written.  For
 * details, see the {@link #setPartial(int,int,boolean)} method.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the Partial properties are set only by the caller.  They will
 * never be set by a Database or Cursor method, nor will they every be set by
 * bindings.  Therefore, the application can assume that the Partial properties
 * are not set, unless the application itself sets them explicitly.</p>
 *
 * <p>See <a href="Cursor.html#partialEntry">Using Partial DatabaseEntry
 * Parameters</a> for more information.</p>
