/**
 * Modes that can be specified for control over caching of records in the JE
 * in-memory cache.  When a record is stored or retrieved, the cache mode
 * determines how long the record is subsequently retained in the JE in-memory
 * cache, relative to other records in the cache.
 *
 * <p>When the cache overflows, JE must evict some records from the cache.  By
 * default, JE uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm for determining which
 * records to evict.  With the LRU algorithm, JE makes a best effort to evict
 * the "coldest" (least recently used or accessed) records and to retain the
 * "hottest" records in the cache for as long as possible.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that JE makes a best effort to implement an approximation of an LRU
 * algorithm, and the very coldest record is not always evicted from the cache
 * first.  In addition, hotness and coldness are applied to the portion of the
 * in-memory BTree that is accessed to perform the operation, not just to the
 * record itself.</p>
 *
 * <p>A non-default cache mode may be explicitly specified to override the
 * default behavior of the LRU algorithm.  When no cache mode is explicitly
 * specified, the default cache mode is {@link #DEFAULT}.  The default mode
 * causes the normal LRU algorithm to be used.</p>
 *
 * <p>An explicit cache mode may be specified as an {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#setCacheMode Environment property}, a {@link
 * DatabaseConfig#setCacheMode Database property}, or a {@link
 * Cursor#setCacheMode Cursor property}.  If none are specified, {@link
 * #DEFAULT} is used.  If more than one non-null property is specified, the
 * Cursor property overrides the Database and Environment properties, and the
 * Database property overrides the Environment property.</p>
 *
 * <p>When all records in a given Database, or all Databases, should be treated
 * the same with respect to caching, using the Database and/or Environment
 * cache mode properties is sufficient. For applications that need finer
 * grained control, the Cursor cache mode property can be used to provide a
 * specific cache mode for individual records or operations.  The Cursor cache
 * mode property can be changed at any time, and the cache mode specified will
 * apply to subsequent operations performed with that Cursor.</p>
 *
 * <p>In a Replicated Environment where a non-default cache mode is desired,
 * the cache mode can be configured on the Master node as described above.
 * However, it is important to configure the cache mode on the Replica nodes
 * using an Environment property.  That way, the cache mode will apply to
 * <em>write</em> operations that are replayed on the Replica for all
 * Databases, even if the Databases are not open by the application on the
 * Replica.  Since all nodes may be Replicas at some point in their life cycle,
 * it is recommended to configure the desired cache mode as an Environment
 * property on all nodes in a Replicated Environment.</p>
 *
 * <p>On a Replica, per-Database control over the cache mode for <em>write</em>
 * operations is possible by opening the Database on the Replica and
 * configuring the cache mode.  Per-Cursor control (meaning per-record or
 * per-operation) control of the cache mode is not possible on a Replica for
 * <em>write</em> operations.  For <em>read</em> operations, both per-Database
 * and per-Cursor control is possible on the Replica, as described above.</p>
 * <p> 
 * The cache related stats in {@link EnvironmentStats} can provide some measure
 * of the effectiveness of the cache mode choice.
