     * The following set of memRecalc methods allow an iteration over the

     * checkpoint by the DirtyINMap class.
     *
     * We flip the INList toggle, recalcToggle, at the beginning of the recalc.
     * At that point, if recalcConsistent is true, all IN toggles have the
     * opposite value of recalcToggle.  As we process INs we flip their
     * toggles.  We can tell whether we have already processed an IN by
     * comparing its toggle to recalcToggle.  If they are equal, we have
     * already processed the IN.
     *
     * The scenarios below describe how the recalcTotal is updated for a
     * particular IN.
     *
     * Scenario #1: IN size is unchanged during the iteration
     *  begin
     *   iterate -- add total IN size, mark processed
     *  end
     *
     * Scenario #2: IN size is updated during the iteration
     *  begin
     *   update  -- do not add delta because IN is not yet processed
     *   iterate -- add total IN size, mark processed
     *   update  -- do add delta because IN was already processed
     *  end
     *
     * Scenario #3: IN is added during the iteration but not iterated
     *  begin
     *   add -- add IN size, mark processed
     *  end
     *
     * Scenario #4: IN is added during the iteration and is iterated
     *  begin
     *   add     -- add IN size, mark processed
     *   iterate -- do not add size because IN was already processed
     *  end
     *
     * Scenario #5: IN is removed during the iteration but not iterated
     *  begin
     *   remove  -- do not add delta because IN is not yet processed
     *  end
     *
     * Scenario #6: IN is removed during the iteration and is iterated
     *  begin
     *   iterate -- add total IN size, mark processed
     *   remove  -- add delta because IN was already processed
     *  end
     *
     * If recalcConsistent is false, the last attempted recalc was not
     * compeleted.  In that case the next reset pass will simply set the toggle
     * in every IN so that they are consistent.  The pass following that will
     * then do a normal recalc.  At the end of any pass, we only update the
     * memory budget if the last recalc was consistent (or this is the first
     * recalc), and the current recalc is completed.
     *
     * We do not synchronize when changing state variables.  In memRecalcBegin
     * and memRecalcEnd it is possible for an IN to be added or removed by
     * another thread in the window between settting recalcInProgress and
     * setting or getting the recalclTotal.  In memRecalcUpdate a similar thing
     * can happen in the window between checking the IN toggle and adding to
     * recalcTotal, if memRecaclcIterate is called by the checkpointer in that
     * window. If this occurs, the reset total can be inaccurate by the amount
     * that was changed in the window.  We have chosen to live with this
     * possible inaccuracy rather than synchronize these methods.  We would
     * have to synchronize every time we add/remove INs and update the size of
     * an IN, which could introduce a new point of contention.
