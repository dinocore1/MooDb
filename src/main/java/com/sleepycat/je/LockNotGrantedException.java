/**
 * Thrown when a non-blocking operation fails to get a lock, and {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#LOCK_OLD_LOCK_EXCEPTIONS} is set to true.  Non-blocking
 * transactions are configured using {@link TransactionConfig#setNoWait}.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Transaction} handle is invalidated as a result of this
 * exception.</p>
 *
 * <p>For compatibility with JE 3.3 and earlier, {@link
 * LockNotGrantedException} is thrown instead of {@link
 * LockNotAvailableException} when {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#LOCK_OLD_LOCK_EXCEPTIONS} is set to true.  This
 * configuration parameter is false by default.  See {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#LOCK_OLD_LOCK_EXCEPTIONS} for information on the changes
 * that should be made to all applications that upgrade from JE 3.3 or
 * earlier.</p>
 *
 * <p>Normally, applications should catch the base class {@link
 * LockConflictException} rather than catching one of its subclasses.  All lock
 * conflicts are typically handled in the same way, which is normally to abort
 * and retry the transaction.  See {@link LockConflictException} for more
 * information.</p>
