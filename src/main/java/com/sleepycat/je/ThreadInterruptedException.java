/**
 * Thrown when {@code java.lang.InterruptedException} (a thread interrupt) or
 * {@code java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException} (which also results from a
 * thread interrupt) occurs in any JE method.  This occurs when the application,
 * or perhaps a library or container that the application is using, calls
 * {@link Thread#interrupt}.
 *
 * <p>Calling {@code Thread.interrupt} is not recommended for an active JE
 * thread if the goal is to stop the thread or do thread coordination. If you
 * interrupt a thread that is executing a JE operation, the state of the
 * environment will be undefined.  That's because JE might have been in the
 * middle of I/O activity when the operation was aborted midstream, and it
 * becomes very difficult to detect and handle all possible outcomes.</p>
 *
 * <p>When JE detects the interrupt, it will mark the environment invalid and
 * will throw a {@code ThreadInterruptedException}. This tells you that you
 * must close the environment and re-open it before using it again. This is
 * necessary, because if JE didn't throw {@code ThreadInterruptedException}, it
 * is very likely that you would get some other exception that is less
 * meaningful, or simply see corrupted data.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Instead, applications should use other mechanisms like {@code
 * Object.notify} and {@code wait} to coordinate threads. For example, use a
 * {@code keepRunning} variable of some kind in each thread. Check this
 * variable in your threads, and return from the thread when it is false. Set
 * it to false when you want to stop the thread. If this thread is waiting to
 * be woken up to do another unit of work, use {@code Object.notify} to wake it
 * up. This is the recommended technique.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, if the use of {@code Thread.interrupt} is unavoidable, be sure
 * to use it only when shutting down the environment.  In this situation,
 * the {@code ThreadInterruptedException} should be expected.  Note that
 * by shutting down the environment abnormally, recovery time will be longer
 * when the environment is subsequently opened, because a final checkpoint was
 * not performed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Existing {@link Environment} handles are invalidated as a result of this
 * exception.</p>
