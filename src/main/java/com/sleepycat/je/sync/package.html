Data synchronization framework that provides the basis for data transfer
between JE Databases and external systems.

<p>TODO (remove this list before the release)</p>
<ul>

<li>Add config option for amount of memory to use for consolidating txns during
an export.<?li>

<li>Add warning: During import, a foreign key constraint on the JE side that
does not match a constraint on the Oracle Server side, will cause a problem.  I
think this is an application design / programming error.</li>

<li>Add import/export config options for number of txn retries and lock
timeout.</li>

<li>Document how the user should manually handle table rename / remove /
truncate on the server side.</li>

<li>Document cases where the user must do a full sync (refreshAll), such as JE
data corruption.</li>

<li>Provide a way to use JDBCSyncProcessor to perform a "custom import" where
the user provides the SELECT statement for reading the change set on the server
side.</li>

<li>Currently the SyncProcessor.getChangeSet method can be overridden so that
the user can provide a custom data set to be exported.  Perhaps a better API
is to allow passing the ChangeSet to the SyncProcessor constructor.</li>

<li>For mobile sync, ChangeReader.ChangeTxn.markChangesPending may need to be a
method on ChangeReader itself, not ChangeTxn, so that all changes in the entire
set can be marked pending at once.  Needs more thought.</li>

</ul>
